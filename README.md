# Lighthouse Labyrinth

Lighthouse Labyrinth is a video game demo created as a Lighthouse Labs final project. It is an adventure maze game built with the Phaser3 JavaScript game engine. On the back-end express is used to connect to a Postgres database.

This repository was a great experience and a wonderful learning opportunity to learn a new library: Phaser3. This experience provided the abilty to take on a new format and learn it quickly, as well as it provided an opportunity to learn about working in a group dynamic. Bringing this game demo to life was an incredible and unforgettable task!
